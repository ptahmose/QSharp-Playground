# QSharp-Playground
Playing around with Q#

Trying to learn some of the basic concepts of quantum computing with [Q#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/quantum/quantum-qr-intro?view=qsharp-preview). Q# is Microsoft's domain-specific programming language used for expressing quantum algorithms. It is part of the [Microsoft Quantum Development Kit](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/quantum/development-kit) - which is an [early preview version](https://blogs.microsoft.com/ai/future-quantum-microsoft-releases-free-preview-quantum-development-kit/).

You will find in this repository:
- an implementation of a quantum 4-bit adder
- a oracle function using this 4-bit adder
- leverage this oracle function by applying Grover's algorithm in order to search for two summands which give a specified sum
