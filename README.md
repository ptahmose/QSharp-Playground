Playing around with Q#

Trying to learn some of the basic concepts of quantum computing with Q#

You will find:
- an implementation of a quantum 4-bit adder
- a oracle function using this 4-bit adder
- leverage this oracle function by applying Grover's algorithm in order to search for two summands which give a specified sum
